# Human Centric Design

1. Goal: support decision-makers in high-stakes situations
2. Principle: maximize benefits of technology, minimizing risks
3. Why it matters: leveraging technology to minimize risks in decision-making environments

## Designs

1. Amplified Decision-Making (high-stake situations)
2. Unbiased Decision-Making
3. Human and AI learning (learning environments for humans and AI)
4. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (uses human feedback to optimize AI models)
