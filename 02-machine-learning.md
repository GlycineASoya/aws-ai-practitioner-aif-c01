# Machine Learning

## Workflow

Data Collection and Preparation -> Select ML algorithm -> Train Model on the Data -> Evaluate the Model Performance -> Data Collection and Preparation -> ....

## Data types

1. Labeled Data
   1. annotated with tags or categories
   2. model learns patterns and making accurate prediction
2. UnLabeled Data
   1. NO tags or categories
   2. used in UnSupervised learning
   3. models identifies patterns by itself
3. Tabular Data
   1. organized in rows and columns
4. Time-series data
   1. sequention data with timestamp
   2. good for identifying anomalies
5. Image data
   1. pixel matrices, video
   2. used in Computer Vision
6. Structured text
   1. predefined format
   2. tagged
   3. CSV is a good example
   4. overlaps with Tabular Data
7. UnStructured Data
   1. free-form text
   2. social media, pdf, etc

## Algorithms

1. Linear Regression
   1. uses relationship between dependent variable and >=1 independent variables
   2. use-case: predicting person's weight based on their height
2. Logistic Regression
   1. binary classification
   2. use-case: spam-filter
   3. use-case: will something happen or not
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   1. classification of the data based on the neighbors classification
   2. use-case: product recommendation based on the user preferences
4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   1. using important features for analysis
   2. use-case: facial recognition

## Training

1. Supervised learning approach
   1. uses labeled data
   2. uses input-output pairs to learn input-output relationship
2. UnSupervised leaning approach
   1. uses unlableled data
   2. uses patterns for categorising input data
   3. used in anomaly detection
3. Reinforcement learning approach
   1. feedback approach
   2. reward-penalty learning (weights)

## Inferencing

1. Batch inferencing
   1. accuracy is the key outcome
   2. large set of data is used to make prediction or decision
   3. used for efficient and scalable analysis
2. Real-time inferencing
   1. speed is the key outcome
   2. prediction or decision is made once data comes
   3. good for video analysis or online systems
