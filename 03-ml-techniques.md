# ML Learning Technigues

1. Regression algorithm
   1. Supervised learning
   2. based on the =1 dependent >=1 independent variables relationships
2. Miltiple regression algortithm
   1. based on the >=2 dependent >=1 independent variables relationships
   2. house pricing based on house params
3. Polynominal regerssion algortithm
   1. based on relationship between dependent and independent variables as a degree polynomial
   2. trajectory of a projectile. Uses time to predict height as a curve, instead of a line
4. Logistic regression algorithm
   1. true or false
5. Classification algorithm
   1. supervised learning
   2. based on labels
   3. accuracy is the strength for these models
6. Clustering algorithm
   1. UNsupervised learning
   2. uses UNlabled data
   3. based on the common characteristics of the data to classify them into groups
7. Hierarchical Clustering algorithm
   1. the same as clustering
   2. the output is a tree data hierarchy
8. DBSCAN Clustering algorithm
   1. the same as clustering
   2. used for anomaly detection
