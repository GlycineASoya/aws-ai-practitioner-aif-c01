# GenAI Lifecycle

1. Data selection - it's massive
2. Model selection
3. Pre-training - self-supervised training - the model learn the meaning, context, and relationship of the words in the datasets
4. Fine-tuning - supervised training - training pre-trained model by adding a smaller, specific datasets (features)
5. Fine-tuning Evaluation - the process of using metrics to evaluate performance and accuracy of the model
6. Deployment - the process of integrating the result model into the existing application infrastucture, leveraging DevOps principles (ML Ops)
7. Feedback - the process of continuous monitoring of deployed model, helps identifying bias, drifts and performance issues
