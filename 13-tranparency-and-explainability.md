# Transparency and Explainability

## Transparency

1. Definition: the characteristic represents the internal decision-making processes visible and interpretable
2. Key points:
   1. the underlying decision-making process is understood
   2. involve simpler models and linear regression
   3. easy to debug and modify
3. Advantages:
   1. high accuracy
   2. high trust and deployment in regulated industries

## Explainability

1. Definition: the characteristic represents the possibility to explain the model's output in human-understandable terms
2. Key Points:
   1. irrelevant to model's complexety, the explaination of the model's output still can be applicable
   2. black-box models' output can be explained as well
3. Advantages:
   1. useful for complex non-linear models
   2. ensures Transparency

## Trade-off

Model Type|Pros|Cons
-|-|-
Transparent|easier to trust, debug, deploy in regulated industries|Performance lack of complex models
Non-Transparent|High accuracy for complex tasks|Lack of interoprability and understanding
