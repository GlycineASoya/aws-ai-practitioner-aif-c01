# GenAI Advantages and Disadvantages

## Advantages

1. Adaptability - can work in different areas
2. Responsiveness - rapid produce output
3. Simplicity - complex workflows into automated processes
4. Creativity and Exploration - can generate new ideas, designs etc
5. Data Efficiency - can learn from relatevely small datasets through pre-training and fine-tuning
6. Personalization - tailor outputs based on the specific needs, context, leveraging memory
7. Scalability - scaled-horizontally to work with different types of data at the same time

## Disadvantages

1. Regulatory Violations - creates content that violates regulatory guidelines, like pisleading advices, inapplicable content
2. Social Risks - use-case: deep fakes
3. Data Security and Privacy - access to the sensitive data and its leakage can happen
4. Toxicity, similar to Social Risks - bad wording, bias, etc
5. Hallucination - non-existing fact present as the actual fact
6. Interpretability - GenAI is a black box and sometimes can cause lack of understanding why the certain output was generated
7. Nondeterminism - good for creativity, bad for a consistent result of a certain prompt
