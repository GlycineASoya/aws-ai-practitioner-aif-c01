# AI Fundametals

## Terminology

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) - vast field focused on creating intelligent systems that can perform tasks fit to human intelligence, like perception, reasoning, decision making
2. Machine Learning (ML) - subset of AI. Focused on learing from a specific date to enhance performance on specific tasks
3. Neural Network - computational model. Represents human brain, consisiting of interconnected layers of nodes, represents neurons, that process, transform data
4. Deep Learning - a subset of Machine Learning. Uses multi-layered neural networks to learn, extract features (portions of data) from large dataset. They are focused on modeling image and speech recognition
5. Computer Vision - field of AI, focused on interpret and understand visual information, such as images, videos
6. Natural Language Processing (NLP) - a part of AI, is focused on interaction and understadning using human language
7. AI Model - computational algorithm, trained on data to perform specific task, such as classification, prediction, pattern, recognition
8. ML Algorithm - set of procedures used to analyse data and make prediction or decision based on pattern
9. AI Model Training - process of teaching a model to make accurate prediction or decision by feeding large amount of data and adjusting its parameters, optimizing performance based on feedback
10. AI Inferencing - process of applying trained model to a new data. The outcome can be real-time or batch
11. AI Model Fairness - concept, ensuring model prediction or decision making isn't under any bias, and is equitable
12. AI Model Fit - concept, describes how well model's prediction or decision match the data it was trained on, indicating accuracy and effectiventes in capturing the patterns
13. Large Language Model (LLM) - model, designed to understand and generate human-like text based data
